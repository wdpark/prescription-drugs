            <h2>The Problem:</h2><br />
            <p>Alec Smith-Holt was a promising restaurant manager growing up in Minnesota. That is, until he turned 26 and aged off his mother’s insurance plan. Alec has Type 1 diabetes. With no insurance, insulin would cost him $1,300 a month—a cost that was too high for his annual salary of $35,000. His salary also disqualifies him from Medicaid and subsidies given in Minnesota, so any options provided by the government were off the table. Another impossible alternative was a $450 premium per month with an annual deductible of $7,600.
            <p>
            With massive costs looming menacingly over Alec, he decided that proceeding uninsured would be the most manageable. He died alone in his apartment due to diabetic ketoacidosis (a condition where the circulatory system is flooded with enough sugars to acidify the body) less that one month after going off of his mother’s insurance. He died because he did not have enough insulin to last him before his payday.
            </p><br />
            <blockquote>
              He died because the price of prescription drugs had risen to a point where he, along with many others, could not afford them.

            <p>Why did this happen? With the advent of numerous medical advances such as insulin, it seems as though certain diseases like diabetes might become something of the past. Despite these developments, however, many Americans like Alec are obstructed from accessing these treatment options as a result of rising costs. More specifically, Americans with chronic illnesses are outraged by the rapid increase in prescription drug prices and consequent rising expense in healthcare. With no uniform healthcare system in place, finding a cheap but simultaneously high-quality treatment for a disease is painstakingly tedious and arduous. It seems as though “big business” is running rampant once again in the pharmaceutical market and that drugs are viewed as a profit-generating commodity rather than a life-saving social benefit.
